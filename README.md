Creating an app that allows users to pay for parking via the app.

Users enter the ticket code which links the app to the organization in which they are parked, e.g 12344 for TRM parking.

Users then enter their ticket number linking their cars to see the parking duration and amount to be paid.

Users then click on the button to pay for parking where after pressing the button a toast message appears informing them to enter their m-pesa pin and an m-pesa prompt is displayed which allows users to enter their m-pesa pin.

Payment status changes from red to green depending on the situation.
